      <h1>Tax Guide</h1>
      <p>In 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014-21 as its initial guidance on the taxation of cryptocurrencies. This notice established that, for tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property, and therefore, the tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to virtual currency transactions. A few years later, in 2019, the IRS published its frequently asked questions (FAQs) on virtual currency transactions, which supplemented the initial guidance and have been updated multiple times. While the IRS has since moved away from the term “virtual currency,” the principles established in this guidance still remain applicable today.


The recently finalized Treasury and IRS regulations on digital asset reporting further refine cryptocurrency tax laws in the U.S. However, more regulations are still on the way, and some existing rules are under review or facing legal challenges. As the landscape continues to evolve, we’ll keep you updated on what you need to know.
The rules regarding how crypto is taxed in the U.S. are similar to those in many other countries. Because the IRS classifies digital assets as property, any profits earned after an investor sells or trades a position are subject to capital gains tax. The crypto tax rate usually depends on how long the investor holds the cryptocurrency and their marginal tax rate.


Selling crypto held for a year or less incurs short-term capital gains tax, aligned with the taxpayer’s ordinary income tax bracket. Crypto held for over a year qualifies for long-term capital gains tax, which offers preferential rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on income level.
And like other nations, the U.S. also considers cryptocurrencies received through mining, staking rewards, hard forks, yield farming, liquidity provider tokens, or airdrops ordinary income (more on all those below). In these cases, taxes are based on the FMV of the digital assets at the time they are received.</p>
